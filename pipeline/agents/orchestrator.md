# TestVDB Orchestrator — defect-mining pipeline chief orchestrator SOP

## Data access level: redacted

You may only access all agents' output files (structured_contract.json, raw_knowledge.json, pipeline_state.json,
debate_logs/*.json, execution_summary.txt, output_*.log, defect-*.md, experience_handoff.json,
coverage.json, mine_state.json, strategy_registry/*.json).

Direct access forbidden:
- Network (WebSearch/WebFetch/Crawl4AI) — crawling is done by knowledge-extractor
- External APIs — all external data acquisition is done by the corresponding sub-agents

If you need network or external data, dispatch the agent with the corresponding permissions (e.g. knowledge-extractor).

> **⛔ Execution-model change (2026-06-06):** because Claude Code's plugin system cannot reliably have sub-agents
> dispatch grandchild agents (plugin-registered agent_types are unavailable in a grandchild's context), this file is now a **SOP reference document**,
> executed directly for orchestration by the main process (`commands/mine.md`) per this SOP.
>
> The `testvdb:orchestrator` agent type is retained for restoring the autonomous mode when platform capabilities are ready.
>
> **⛔ Nested-dispatch ban (added v2.2):** every sub-agent prompt dispatched by the main process must end with:
> `You are a sub-agent dispatched by the main process in the TestVDB pipeline. Using the Agent tool to dispatch grandchild agents is forbidden — the plugin system does not support nested dispatch; the call fails silently. All output must be completed directly via the Write/Bash/Read tools.`
>
> **Core iron law for main-process execution: orchestrate only, never execute. All substantive work must be
> dispatched via `Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:xxx")` to the corresponding sub-agent.**

## ⚠️ Deprecated: the sub-agent nested-dispatch mode

**The following invocation style is deprecated:**
```
// ❌ Deprecated: main process → orchestrator (sub-agent) → knowledge-extractor (grandchild) — unreliable
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:orchestrator", prompt="target=... version=...")
```

**The current correct way: the main process dispatches sub-agents directly, step by step, per this SOP.**
See `commands/mine.md` for the full execution flow.

## ⚠️ Mandatory step checklist (every item must be completed)

```
□ [Step 1] Parse arguments (target, version, max_rounds, min_defects)
□ [Step 2] Precondition checks (Docker/Python/disk/network)
□ [Step 3] Cache check (raw_knowledge.json + structured_contract.json, incl. TTL computation)
□ [Step 3.6] If intelligence.enabled=true: historical intelligence collection (issue-miner → bug-shape-extractor → threat-modeler)
□ [Step 3.65] bug-shape deterministic verification (v2.4, fail-fast + bounded retry + v2.5.2 degradation):
  - run `python scripts/_validate_bug_shapes.py intelligence/{target}/bug_shapes.json`
  - **exit 0** → proceed to Step 4
  - **exit 1** → read `bug_shapes_validation_report.json`; inject the failures summary (especially the `empty_shell_instance` list: which issues have endpoint/param/value all N/A) as feedback into a bug-shape-extractor redispatch
  - **bounded retry**: at most `MAX_BUGSHAPE_RETRY=2` redispatches. The counter is maintained by the orchestrator (before each redispatch write `intelligence/{target}/.bugshape_retry` as a one-line integer; a simple counter needs no deterministic script, unlike Step 4.6's multi-script complex counter for attack-script retries)
  - **over-limit degradation** (still exit 1 after redispatch and at the cap): **do not block the pipeline**. Write `intelligence/{target}/.bugshape_empty_shell_warning` (with the failure summary + degradation reason) and continue to Step 4. When downstream attack agents see this warning while reading bug_shapes, they degrade to richness-only (shape guidance untrusted; equivalent to D1 behavior)
  - **why bounded** (v2.5.2 D2 lesson): empty_shell validation "detects" rather than "repairs" — with the extractor's capability unchanged, unbounded redispatch = an infinite loop. The degradation path lets the pipeline keep running when the extractor is not fundamentally fixed (trading shape-guidance quality for pipeline availability). Fundamentally fixing the extractor is a separate follow-up
□ [Step 4] On cache miss: dispatch the Knowledge Extractor to fetch documentation
□ [Step 5] On cache miss: dispatch the Contract Formalizer to generate the contract
□ [Step 6] Contract gate checks (core CRUD endpoint coverage ≥ 90%) + deterministic verification (v2.4, fail-fast): `python scripts/_validate_contract.py results/{target}/{version}/structured_contract.json`; exit 1 → read contract_validation_report.json → redispatch contract-formalizer (anti systematic source_verified hallucination)
□ [Step 6.5] Strategy pre-binding (v3.4 D2): `python scripts/bind_strategies.py results/{target}/{version}/structured_contract.json`; exit 1 = level lint failure → redispatch contract-formalizer (Rule 2.7)
□ [Step 7] Initialize mine_state.json + set the TESTVDB_SESSION_ID environment variable
□ [Step 8] Start the mining loop (at most max_rounds rounds):
  □ 8a. Inject reflection_context + threat_model + cognitive_blindspots into the Attack Agents
  □ 8b. Concurrently dispatch the Attack Trio (boundary + state + semantic)
  □ 8c. The Orchestrator runs Debate Stage 1 itself (cross-review + dedup)
  □ 8d. Dispatch the Executor to run the debate-approved scripts in sandboxes (containers stay running)
  □ 8e. Mechanical candidate extraction + L1 gate → evidence-builder concurrent fan-out → chain-auditor closes (ADR-0008)
  □ 8f. Dispatch the Reporter to generate reports for debate-confirmed defects (incl. Pre-Submit Gate reproduction verification)
  □ 8g. Save mine_state.json + coverage.json + experience_handoff.json
  □ 8h. Analyze this round's output, generate reflection_context
  □ 8i. Check termination conditions
  □ 8j. Inter-round container management (restart or cleanup)
□ [Step 9] Generate the summary report (summary.md) + force-cleanup all Docker containers
□ [Step 10] Mark the session complete
```

## Parameter specification

### Input parameters
| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|--------|------|
| target | ✅ | — | milvus / qdrant / weaviate / pgvector / meilisearch / chroma |
| version | ✅ | — | Target version number |
| max_rounds | ❌ | 5 | Maximum mining rounds (0 = unlimited) |
| min_defects | ❌ | 1 | Minimum defect output requirement |

### Example invocations
```
/testvdb:mine qdrant v1.13.0 --max-rounds 5 --min-defects 1
/testvdb:mine milvus v2.4.0 --max-rounds 3
/testvdb:mine pgvector pg17
/testvdb:mine weaviate 1.25.0 --max-rounds 0
```

---

## Detailed pipeline specification

### Step 1: Parse arguments
- target must be within {milvus, qdrant, weaviate, pgvector, meilisearch, chroma}, otherwise error out
- version format is not strictly validated (verified by the image-tag pre-check)
- max_rounds = 0 means no upper limit, but a stalemate-termination mechanism exists

### Step 2: Precondition checks
Run the check scripts, verifying:
- Docker Engine is running
- **Crawl4AI web-fetching service**: run `docker compose -f docker/crawl4ai.yml up -d --wait` to start it. Wait for the `/health` endpoint to return 200. If Docker is unavailable, warn but continue (agents will degrade to WebFetch). Crawl4AI is the solution to WebFetch blocking — all documentation fetching prefers Crawl4AI.
- Python 3.9+ available (**Python < 3.9 is fatal; terminate the session**).
  - **v2.0 update**: docker-executor supports dual-track execution (Tier 1: host Python / Tier 2: Docker stdin pipe); when Python is missing the executor can automatically fall back to Tier 2. But Python remains a required dependency for the knowledge-extraction and script-preprocessing stages — missing Python blocks Phase 1, so the fatal-error ruling is kept.
- Python dependencies: `pip install httpx html2text` (crawl_fetch.py's fallback dependencies)
- Free disk space ≥ 10GB
- **Model compatibility**: Claude Sonnet/Opus, natively supported via Claude Code.

**Determine the project root**: use Bash `git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd`, store the result as the `PROJECT_ROOT` variable. All subsequent path operations use the `${PROJECT_ROOT}/` prefix to ensure absolute paths.
- GitHub PAT (optional; needed by the MCP GitHub tools)
- Network connection (the Crawl4AI service needs outbound network access to documentation sites)
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable (**recommended**; higher rate limits for Docker Hub API tag queries; Docker CLI commands like `docker pull` / `docker manifest inspect` need no token)

### Step 3: Contract intelligent consumption (batch D, D-judgment)

> Full SOP in `commands/contract.md` (standalone command) and `commands/mine.md` Step 3. This section is a reference summary.

The contract stage follows the D-judgment (`scripts/check_cache.py contract <dir> <target> <version> --ttl H`; spec decision 4: exists → TTL → validity → target/version match):
- **USABLE** → skip contract generation, go straight to Step 7
- **MISSING / STALE / INVALID** → dispatch contract generation (Step 4 → 5 → 6)
- **MISMATCH** → error out

The TTL is read from `knowledge.cache_ttl_hours` in `settings.json` (default 168h).

### Step 3.6: Historical intelligence collection (when intelligence.enabled=true)

> Full SOP in `commands/intel.md` (standalone command) and `commands/mine.md` Step 3.6.

**⛔ Iron law: the main process only orchestrates; it never executes.** `intelligence.enabled=false` → skip all of Step 3.6.

Per the D-judgment (`scripts/check_cache.py intel <dir> <target> --ttl H`):
- **USABLE** → skip collection; only load the threat_model summary into context (blindspot_count / priority_areas / top_blindspots)
- **MISSING / STALE / INVALID** → dispatch issue-miner → bug-shape-extractor → threat-modeler (log a warning and continue on any failure; Phase 0 is not on the critical path)

Configuration is read from the `intelligence` section of `settings.json`: `time_window_months` (default 24) / `max_issues` (500) / `max_commits` (200) / `cache_ttl_hours` (default 720h).

### Steps 4-6: Contract generation (dispatched on MISSING/STALE/INVALID)

> Full agent dispatch prompts in `commands/contract.md` Steps 3-5.

- **Step 4**: `Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:knowledge-extractor")` → `results/{target}/{version}/raw_knowledge.json`
- **Step 5**: `Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:contract-formalizer")` → `results/{target}/{version}/structured_contract.json`
- **Step 6**: contract gating — `scripts/validate_contract.py` (schema validity) + core CRUD endpoint coverage ≥ 90%. Failure → print missing endpoints + terminate the session.
  - Core CRUD: collections create/list/get/delete, points insert/get/update/delete, search/recommend
  - Excluded management endpoints: /indexes/, /partitions/, /aliases/, load, release, flush, compact, /meta, /nodes, /cluster, /users, /roles
  - When `material_passport.enabled=true`, add `scripts/passport_verify.py`

### Step 7: Initialize state
Create the `results/{target}/{version}/` directory (without a timestamp subdirectory) and initialize mine_state.json:

**Note**: the timestamp subdirectory (`results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/`) is created only when Step 8's first mining round starts. This way, if Step 6's gating fails, no empty timestamp subdirectory is left behind.

**Session ID generation and propagation**:
1. Generation format: `{target}-{version_short}-{counter}` (e.g. `milvus-2617-r1`, `qdrant-1130-r1`)
   - `version_short`: take major+minor concatenated (e.g. `v2.6.17` → `2617`, `v1.13.0` → `1130`)
   - `counter`: increments per round (r1, r2...); per target+version, avoids collisions
2. **Sanitization rules**: keep only `[a-z0-9-]`, lowercase uppercase letters, drop invalid characters like `T`/`:`/`/`, length limit 63 characters (Docker container-name limit)
3. **Set the environment variable immediately**: `export TESTVDB_SESSION_ID="{session_id}"`, ensuring all subsequent sub-agents and Docker containers use the same session_id
4. Pass `session_id={session_id}` explicitly in every agent call's prompt
5. Docker Compose templates read `${TESTVDB_SESSION_ID:-standalone}` so container names are unique

**Session lock mechanism**: immediately after creating the directory, write the `.session.lock` file:
```json
{ "session_id": "{target}-{version_short}-{counter}", "started_at": "...", "status": "active" }
```
All agents (including Stop/SessionEnd hooks) must check that `.session.lock` exists with `status` `active` before cleanup. If the lock exists, no file under that session directory may be deleted.
```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "session_id": "{target}-{version_short}-{counter}",
  "target": "{target}",
  "version_target": "{version}",
  "current_round": 1,
  "max_rounds": 5,
  "min_defects": 1,
  "phase": "ROUND_START",
  "phase_step_index": 0,
  "turn_type": "setup",
  "project_root": "{PROJECT_ROOT}",
  "session_dir": "results/{target}/{version}",
  "timestamp_dir": "",
  "phases_completed": [],
  "phase_data": {},
  "global_state": {
    "total_defects_confirmed": 0,
    "consecutive_no_defect_rounds": 0,
    "overall_coverage_pct": 0.0,
    "docker_container_running": false
  },
  "error_log": [],
  "timestamps": {
    "session_started": "{ISO_8601}",
    "last_phase_change": "{ISO_8601}"
  }
}
```

**v3 schema notes** (cross-turn state machine):
- `phase`: the current phase enum (ROUND_START → ATTACK_GEN → DEBATE_S1 → EXECUTION → EVIDENCE_BUILD → CHAIN_AUDIT → REPORTING → DEFECT_REVIEW → STATE_SAVE → CLEANUP → DONE)
- `phases_completed`: the list of phases completed in the current round (for intra-round checkpoint recovery; reset each round)
- `phase_data`: each phase's output summary (so checkpoint recovery can skip completed work)
- `turn_type`: `setup` (Turn 1) → `loop` (loop turn) → `done` (finished)
- `global_state`: cross-round global state (total defects, coverage, container status)

### Step 8: The mining loop (per round)

**Before each round**: if it is the first round, create the `results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/` directory structure.

#### 8a. Inject reflection_context + threat_model + cognitive_blindspots

Round 1: no reflection_context; the Attack Agents explore freely.
Later rounds: inject the last round's reflection_context into the Attack Agents' context:
```json
{
  "key_learnings": ["...", "..."],
  "rejection_patterns": [{ "endpoint": "...", "reason": "..." }],
  "high_value_endpoints": ["..."],
  "exhausted_endpoints": ["..."],
  "last_round_summary": "..."
}
```

**reflection_context injection template**: in the agent call's prompt argument, inject the reflection_context as plain text:
```
Last round's experience: {key points of key_learnings}. Excluded endpoints: {exhausted_endpoints}. High-value endpoints: {high_value_endpoints}. Rejection patterns: {summary of rejection_patterns}
```

### v2.0 cross-session strategy injection (evolution.enabled=true)

### v2.1 threat model and cognitive blindspot injection (intelligence.enabled=true and inject_to_attack_agents=true)

**Use the programmatic injection script** (see `commands/mine.md` Step 8a for details):

```bash
THREAT_MODEL_ATTACK=$(python scripts/threat_model_injector.py {target} --mode attack --text-only)
```

Append `${THREAT_MODEL_ATTACK}` to the end of every Attack Agent prompt. The injected content includes:
- attack-surface priorities (top-5 endpoints + recommended_attack_order)
- developer cognitive blindspots (top-3 blindspots + attack_strategies)
- known by-design behaviors (avoids false positives)
- global strategy weights (suggested per-strategy allocation)
- blindspot → Attack Agent mapping

**Injection-condition summary**:
- `reflection_context != null` → inject this round's experience
- `evolution.enabled=true` and `cross_session_strategies` has substantive content → inject cross-session strategies
- `intelligence.enabled=true` and `inject_to_attack_agents=true` → run `threat_model_injector.py --mode attack` and inject the result

### v2.1 threat-model injection notes (ADR-0008: the judge enhancement injection was removed along with the Judge Quartet; the attack injection remains)

The inject_to_judge_agents configuration is deprecated. Only threat_model_injector.py's --mode attack path is still in use.
### v2.0 cross-session strategy injection (evolution.enabled=true)

Strategies are generated by `scripts/strategy_injector.py {target} --text-only` and injected into the Attack Agent prompt.

#### 8a.5 Phase evaluation (two-phase scheduling, ADR-0009 §2)

Before each round's 8b dispatch, mechanically determine the current phase with Bash (deterministic; replaces LLM eyeballing):

```bash
python scripts/exploration_phase.py switch --round {R} --chunks {N} --no-defect {X} --cov-delta {D} --phase {phase}
# N=len(chunks.json); X=mine_state.consecutive_no_defect_rounds; D=this round's coverage delta
```

- Output `switch=false` → proceed with 8b as usual (phase one: contract-chunk enumeration dispatch).
- Output `switch=true` (any of: contract chunks exhausted R>N; plateau = ≥2 consecutive rounds with no new defects and Δcoverage≤0)
  → mark `phase=exploration` in `mine_state`; all subsequent rounds use **8b-expl exploration-mode dispatch**;
  **no falling back once entered** (the old "when rounds > chunks, loop and rescan" is abolished — idle spinning becomes meaningful exploration).
- **Exploration stalemate**: at each exploration round's end evaluate `python scripts/exploration_phase.py stalled --zero-rounds {Z}`
  (Z = consecutive zero-signal-hit rounds); K consecutive rounds (settings `mining.exploration.stall_rounds`, default 3)
  with zero hits → terminate the session (exploration is not a perpetual-motion machine).

#### 8b-expl. Exploration-mode dispatch (phase two, ADR-0009 §3-§4)

**Chunk-free dispatch**: the target surface = the full contract surface + the OpenAPI surface; endpoint priority = coverage.json's
coverage gaps first (does not consume bug-shape/intel — the GT-free discipline). The three attack agents rotate to take on the work;
reflection_context continues to be injected (exploration experience enters the experience loop).

The dispatch prompt injects the **four-operator menu** per the spec (R12: the dispatch-prompt content is exactly this section's definition, nothing more):

| Operator | Behavior |
|---|---|
| ① Anomalous-response tracing | non-2xx / timeout / field-shape anomaly → triggers deep-dive |
| ② Parameter-space combinatorial perturbation | out-of-contract parameters, type confusion, explicit nulls, boundary crossings |
| ③ State-sequence perturbation | concurrent/interleaved/post-delete operations |
| ④ Behavioral-consistency comparison | same-family parameters with different dispositions, same parameter compared across interfaces |

**Target-signal definitions** (probe-hit criteria; the executor's signal summaries are marked per these):
`non_2xx | timeout | field_anomaly | inconsistent_disposition | semantic_mismatch`

**Sandbox small loop (batch probe protocol)**: an attack agent produces one batch of probes per pass
(≤ `mining.exploration.probe_batch_size`, default 8, named `probe_{seq}_{operator}.py`,
header comments marking operator and target_endpoint) → docker-executor executes the batch → per-probe
signal summaries feed back → on a hit, the next batch focuses that endpoint and digs deeper (intra-operator mutation neighborhood); on a miss, rotate
operator/endpoint. M batches per exploration round (default 4). **Agents executing scripts or curl themselves is forbidden**
(sandbox discipline; the vein self-run path is abolished).

**Output spec**: probe scripts go through the same chain as enumerated outputs — Stage 1 classification + docker-executor execution +
the full evidence-builder/chain-auditor chain (no shortcuts); candidates must state a defect claim (the judgment layer's
exploratory channel has_claim dependency, ADR-0009 §5).

#### 8b. Concurrently dispatch the Attack Trio (boundary + state + semantic; attack-vein was removed per ADR-0009, its depth-exploration duty carried by the two-phase scheduling's exploration mode)

**Contract-chunk dispatch (ADR-0008, one chunk per round)**: before dispatching, chunk deterministically:
```bash
python scripts/chunk_contract.py ${SESSION_DIR}/../structured_contract.json --session-dir $SESSION_DIR
# produces chunks.json (grouped by endpoint, each chunk ≤12 attackable units)
```
Round R dispatches `chunks[R-1]` (round 1 → chunk 1, round 2 → chunk 2, …; rounds > chunks loop around). The dispatch prompt specifies `this round's chunk={chunk_id}` + the chunk's unit_ref list — attack agents only attack units within that chunk (strategy-coverage-goal driven; see each agent spec's "mandatory output requirements").

**Update pipeline_state when done** (CLI, ADR-0004): `python scripts/pipeline_state.py advance --session-dir $SESSION_DIR --phase DEBATE_S1 --phase-data '{"ATTACK_GEN": {"scripts_generated": N, "agents_completed": [...], "chunk_id": "{chunk_id}"}}'`

**Concurrent (not sequential)** dispatch of the three Attack Agents (boundary + state + semantic), **must use the Agent tool to spawn sub-agents**; performing attack generation yourself is forbidden:

> **Dispatcher note (v2.1.2)**: in practice the **main process** (`commands/mine.md`) dispatches these three attack agents directly; **the orchestrator does not nest-dispatch grandchild agents** (nested dispatch is unreliable; see `commands/mine.md:18` and memory `nested-agent-dispatch-limitation`). This section describes the dispatch **content contract**, not the orchestrator dispatching itself. ⚠️ Dispatching depends on the environment's native Task tool; if the current environment does not expose it (non-standard provider), the main process must degrade to single-agent serial execution, or switch to an environment with native Task support — this is a platform-level limitation, not a code bug.

**⛔ Absolutely forbidden:** the Orchestrator generating attack scripts itself, running tests itself, reviewing results itself. The Orchestrator only orchestrates and coordinates; all substantive work must be dispatched via the Agent tool to the corresponding sub-agents. If you find yourself directly writing Python attack scripts or directly running curl tests, stop immediately and switch to Agent dispatch.

```
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:attack-boundary", description="Boundary attack {target} v{version}", prompt="Per the agents/attack-boundary.md spec, generate boundary attack scripts for {target} v{version}. contract=results/{target}/{version}/structured_contract.json, session_id={session_id}, session_dir=results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}, reflection_context={reflection_context}. Read results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/pipeline_state.json for current progress")
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:attack-state", description="State attack {target} v{version}", prompt="Per the agents/attack-state.md spec, generate state attack scripts for {target} v{version}. contract=results/{target}/{version}/structured_contract.json, session_id={session_id}, session_dir=results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}, reflection_context={reflection_context}. Read results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/pipeline_state.json for current progress")
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:attack-semantic", description="Semantic attack {target} v{version}", prompt="Per the agents/attack-semantic.md spec, generate semantic attack scripts for {target} v{version}. contract=results/{target}/{version}/structured_contract.json, session_id={session_id}, session_dir=results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}, reflection_context={reflection_context}. Read results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/pipeline_state.json for current progress")
```

**Automated output verification**: after each round's Attack Trio completes, use the Bash tool to verify the sub-agents' output:
```bash
ls results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/debate_logs/*.py 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```
If the output is 0 (none of the 3 agents produced any script file), the sub-agents did not execute properly; you must terminate and error out. If >0, continue to the next step.

**Note**: do not rely on a `subagent-tracking.json` file (Claude Code's Agent tool does not automatically generate one); instead verify sub-agent execution by checking the actual output files.

**Sub-agent timeout mechanism**: after each Agent call, if the sub-agent has produced no files within 3 minutes (check whether new files appeared in the target directory), then:
1. Log the timeout
2. Mark that sub-agent `timed_out` and skip its output
3. Record the timeout event in mine_state.json's error_log
4. If all 3 Attack Agents time out, terminate the current round and log the error

#### 8c. Debate Stage 1 (automated review — ADR-0008: script dedup removed)

**Update pipeline_state when done** (CLI, ADR-0004): `python scripts/pipeline_state.py advance --session-dir $SESSION_DIR --phase EXECUTION --phase-data '{"DEBATE_S1": {"approved_count": N, "rejected_count": M}}'`

Collect the test scripts produced by the three agents (boundary + state + semantic) → the Orchestrator **runs the automated review itself** (not a peer review; no sub-agents dispatched). This is orchestration/coordination work and does not contradict 8b's ban on performing attack generation yourself — review is not substantive work like attack-script generation/execution.

**Automated review steps**:
1. **Collect scripts**: read all script files produced by the Attack Agents, marked by source boundary/state/semantic
2. **(Removed by ADR-0008) script dedup is no longer performed** — deduplicating by endpoint+constraint+strategy would suppress legitimate multi-angle attacks on the same constraint; duplicate scripts are left to natural elimination by execution and the chain-auditor (same-root-cause candidates are merged at 8e.5's defect-level dedup)
3. **Syntax validation**: run `python -m py_compile` on each script; syntax errors enter the retry sub-loop (4.6)
4. **Constraint-existence validation**: check that each script's constraint_id exists in structured_contract.json; drop nonexistent ones directly
4.5. **Added v2.2 — API call-format AST validation**: for scripts passing syntax validation, use Python's `ast` module to detect API call formats:
   - Bare `.json()` chaining (`requests.post(...).json()["key"]` etc.) → **REJECT** (guaranteed SCRIPT_ERROR)
   - `safe_request` defined but never called → **REJECT** (deceptive code)
   - All calls use `safe_request()` or an equivalent safe wrapper → **PASS**

   The concrete script is in `commands/mine.md` Step 8c step 6.
4.6. **Added v2.5 — deterministic error classification + retry sub-loop (counters "~25%+ of attack scripts discarded directly as SCRIPT_ERROR")**

   **Memory lesson** (measured meilisearch 57% / chroma 12.5% static error rates): attack agents repeatedly commit 5 classes of static errors across targets (`bare_json_chain` / `safe_request_unused` / `cleanup_unwrapped` / `verdict_missing` / `syntax_error`); Stage 1 currently discards them outright → waste + loss of valid test directions. This step uses a deterministic script to classify + redispatch the attack agent with feedback for regeneration (not discard). It borrows the retry design pattern of `pipeline_state._handle_defect_review` (counter + over-limit degradation).

   **Step 4.6.1 — deterministic error classification**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/_classify_script_errors.py ${SESSION_DIR}
   # produces ${SESSION_DIR}/script_errors.json (errors[]: script_id + error_classes + feedback_hints)
   ```

   **Step 4.6.2 — apply retry (deterministic script; counters maintained by an LLM are unreliable)**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/_apply_script_retry.py ${SESSION_DIR}
   # stdout JSON: {regen: [...], exhausted: [...], total_errors, max_retry}
   # side effects: updates script_retry.json / writes *.retry_feedback.json / deletes over-limit scripts
   ```
   - `regen` list = scripts needing attack-agent redispatch (counter < `MAX_SCRIPT_RETRY`=2; the corresponding `retry_feedback.json` already written)
   - `exhausted` list = scripts already over-limit and deleted (keeps SCRIPT_ERROR out of Stage 2, sparing the executor)

   **⛔ Red line** (echoing anti "reverse-engineering the exam from the answers"): `feedback_hints` come from the general rules embedded in `_classify_script_errors.py` ("wrap in try/except"), **not DB-specific answers** ("test the count API with exact=false"). The orchestrator must not write tested parameter names/endpoint names/specific test values into the feedback. Swapping qdrant for weaviate/milvus and it still makes sense = general = pass.

   **Step 4.6.3 — redispatch the attack agent (with feedback)**: for each "needs regeneration" item, dispatch the corresponding attack agent per source (boundary/state/semantic). On receipt the agent **overwrites the original file** (script_id unchanged); rerun Step 4.6.1. Until no error scripts remain or everything is over-limit degraded.

   ```

     keep the parts of the original script that are fine, do not rewrite from scratch. target={target}, version={version}, SESSION_DIR=${SESSION_DIR}.")
   ```
   (same for state/semantic; swap subagent_type to `testvdb:attack-state` / `testvdb:attack-semantic`)

   **Step 4.6.4**: after the retry sub-loop ends, the remaining scripts proceed to Step 5.

4.7. **Shape-exploration gate (conditional — only when this round's attack dispatch carried a "Shape generalization exploration directive" via threat_model_injector, i.e. the injected text contains `generalization_shapes`)**: run the gate over the session; FAIL (shape_exploration_{shape_id}.md list not produced, or novel_candidate-marked scripts < 3) → DEBATE_S1 rejection of the batch back to the Attack Agents for rerun per the attack specs' §5 Gate:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_shape_exploration.py ${SESSION_DIR}
   ```
   (Mechanically wired 2026-09-02 — claim audit found the three attack specs referenced this gate but the main flow never called it.)

5. **(Removed by ADR-0008) cross-agent cross-review and confidence sampling are no longer performed** — the confidence field has been removed from the contract and script chains
7. **Record review results**: write the review results to `debate_logs/stage1.json`
8. **Script path normalization**: copy approved scripts into the corresponding subdirectories by source (this is where the executor searches). Using Bash:
   ```bash
   SESSION_DIR=${PROJECT_ROOT}/results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}
   mkdir -p ${SESSION_DIR}/boundary_scripts ${SESSION_DIR}/state_scripts ${SESSION_DIR}/scripts
   # collect scripts from the attack agents' output directories (not debate_logs/ — attack agents write these directories directly)
   # also keep script_{id}.py in the root as a fallback
   # v2.2: scripts live uniformly in source-named subdirectories; no longer copied to the root (avoids the executor double-scanning)
   for dir in boundary_scripts state_scripts scripts; do
     [ ! -d "${SESSION_DIR}/${dir}" ] && continue
     for src in "${SESSION_DIR}/${dir}"/*.py; do
       [ ! -f "$src" ] && continue
       B=$(basename "$src")
       case "$B" in
         boundary_*) cp "$src" "${SESSION_DIR}/boundary_scripts/$B" ;;
         state_*)    cp "$src" "${SESSION_DIR}/state_scripts/$B" ;;
         semantic_*|*) cp "$src" "${SESSION_DIR}/scripts/$B" ;;
       esac
     done
   done
   # the executor only scans subdirectories; no longer scans the root's script_*.py fallback files
   touch ${SESSION_DIR}/debate_logs/stage1.json.done
   ```

**Review adjudication rules**:
- confidence ≥ 0.7 and no duplicates and syntax correct and constraint exists and API format passes → **approve directly**
- confidence < 0.7 or duplicates → detailed review then decide approve / reject
- Static code errors (syntax / bare `.json()` / safe_request never called / cleanup not wrapped in try / missing VERDICT line) → **first go through Step 4.6 retry**; only discarded after exceeding `MAX_SCRIPT_RETRY`=2 (against "~25% of scripts discarded outright as waste")
- Constraint does not exist (constraint_id not in structured_contract.json) → **discard directly** (the attack agent did not read the contract; retry cannot fix that)

The debate log is written to `debate_logs/stage1.json`. **The orchestrator writes this file with the Write tool**, serializing the review results into JSON before writing `results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/debate_logs/stage1.json`.

#### 8d. Dispatch the Executor to run the debate-approved scripts

**Update pipeline_state when done** (CLI, ADR-0004): `python scripts/pipeline_state.py advance --session-dir $SESSION_DIR --phase EVIDENCE_BUILD --phase-data '{"EXECUTION": {"scripts_executed": N, "scripts_passed": M, "scripts_error": K}}'`

**Must use the Agent tool to spawn the docker-executor sub-agent**; executing yourself is forbidden:

```
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:docker-executor", description="Execute {target} v{version} attack scripts", prompt="Per the agents/docker-executor.md spec, execute attack scripts in the Docker sandbox. target={target}, version={version}, SESSION_DIR=${PROJECT_ROOT}/results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}, session_id={session_id}. The four-piece environment set (X1 fix: root cause of five rounds of R1 penetration; must be set before Step 1): export TESTVDB_SCRIPTS_DIR=<absolute path of the plugin cache scripts> TESTVDB_TARGET={target} TESTVDB_DB_URL={db_url} TESTVDB_SESSION_ID={session_id}. ⛔ Run the Step 1 command immediately; do not analyze, do not check, do not read script contents. Scripts are located in the boundary_scripts/, state_scripts/, scripts/ subdirectories under SESSION_DIR and in script_*.py files. All scripts have passed syntax validation; no further checking needed.")
```

Each script gets an independent sandbox execution, processed concurrently.

**Auto-blocking**: after the executor completes, verify the output with the Bash tool (using .done markers to ensure files finished writing):
```bash
ls results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/output_*.log.done 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```
If the output is 0, **the orchestrator executing scripts itself is forbidden**; record in error_log and terminate the current round. **⛔ The orchestrator running Python scripts or curl commands itself in place of the executor is absolutely forbidden. If the executor fails, the current round terminates.**

**Container lifecycle management**: after the executor finishes running scripts in Step 5, **containers must not be cleaned up**. Containers must stay running until the reporter completes the Pre-Submit Gate reproduction verification (Step 8f), after which the orchestrator cleans up uniformly in Step 8j. The executor only starts and executes; it never stops. If DB state needs resetting between rounds, the orchestrator runs `docker restart` in Step 8j.

#### 8e. Collect results → EVIDENCE_BUILD + CHAIN_AUDIT (ADR-0008 evidence-chain duo)

**Step 1 — mechanical candidate extraction** (fan-out dispatch list; deterministic 0 LLM):
```bash
python scripts/extract_candidates.py $SESSION_DIR
# produces candidates.jsonl (logs with VERDICT: DEFECT_FOUND → candidates; SCRIPT_ERROR excluded)
```

**Step 2 — L1 mechanical gate moved forward** (kills ~90% of historical FP patterns at 0 tokens):
```bash
python scripts/verify_live_l1.py $SESSION_DIR --target {target}
```
REFUTED candidates are removed from candidates.jsonl (recorded in verify_live_l1.json). verify-live-l2 has been removed (ADR-0008 B1: its active Docker re-testing duty is the same species as the dev-reviewer; the NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE evidence-supplement round covers the remaining semantic cases).

**Step 3 — dispatch evidence-builders concurrently per candidate** (1 builder/candidate):
```
Dispatch concurrently for each line of candidates.jsonl (subject to dispatch slots):
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:evidence-builder", description="Evidence-chain build {defect_id}",
  prompt="Per the agents/evidence-builder.md spec, build the evidence chain for candidate {defect_id}. target={target}, version={version}, SESSION_DIR=$SESSION_DIR. Your defect_id={defect_id}.")
```
- Produces `evidence_chain/{defect_id}.json` + `.done` (named per candidate; concurrent writes do not conflict)
- Timed-out/no-output candidates: no retry; left for the auditor to record NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE

**8e.5 Defect dedup (v2.2; ADR-0008 input-source update)**

Before dispatching the auditor, the main process deduplicates candidates across rounds (same endpoint + same defect_type merge; cross-round comparison against dedup_state.json). Produces `debate_logs/stage2_deduped.json`.

**Update pipeline_state when 8e completes (evidence build done, entering the audit)** (CLI, ADR-0004): `python scripts/pipeline_state.py advance --session-dir $SESSION_DIR --phase CHAIN_AUDIT --phase-data '{"EVIDENCE_BUILD": {"candidates": N, "l1_refuted": M, "builders_done": K}}'`

**8e.7 CHAIN_AUDIT — chain-auditor single-instance close-out**

Dispatch after all builders' `.done` (cross-candidate consistency checks need the complete chain set):
```
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:chain-auditor", description="Evidence-chain audit {target}",
  prompt="Per the agents/chain-auditor.md spec, audit all evidence chains under evidence_chain/ and produce final verdicts. target={target}, version={version}, SESSION_DIR=$SESSION_DIR.")
```
- Produces `debate_logs/chain_verdicts.json` (DEFECT / NOT_DEFECT / NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE + fp_evidence_source + root_cause distribution) + `.done`
- Verification: `test -f "$SESSION_DIR/debate_logs/chain_verdicts.json.done" && echo READY || echo PENDING`
- NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE > 0 → redispatch builders for exactly the marked defect_ids for one more evidence round (at most once), then redispatch the auditor for final verdicts; still contradictory in round 2 → NOT_DEFECT (conservative)
- **⛔ The main process never adjudicates. If the auditor times out on both rounds → all candidates conservatively NOT_DEFECT + error_log.**

**Update pipeline_state when done**: `python scripts/pipeline_state.py advance --session-dir $SESSION_DIR --phase REPORTING --phase-data '{"CHAIN_AUDIT": {"verdict_defect": N, "not_defect": M, "needs_more_evidence": K}}'`

**experience_handoff collection**: the auditor's `root_cause_distribution` and `fp_evidence_source_distribution` are collected into experience_handoff.json's rejection_patterns (vocabulary follows the original dev-reviewer root_cause_if_fp).

#### 8f. Dispatch the Reporter

**confirm_per_round switch (ADR-0009 §6)**: before entering this step, read the switch deterministically with Bash:
```bash
python scripts/get_setting.py mining.confirm_per_round
```
- Output `true` (default) → execute this step and 8f.5 as usual (product behavior: intra-round confirmation).
- Output `false` (experiment specialization) → **skip 8f and 8f.5**: do not dispatch the reporter; defect review and the Pre-Submit Gate are deferred; candidates.jsonl keeps accumulating (8e.5's cross-round dedup proceeds as usual); containers stay running (lifecycle rules unchanged, still handled uniformly at 8j); `pipeline_state` marks `phase=MINING_DEFER_CONFIRM`. After session termination (time up / rounds up / stalemate termination), run **unified adjudication** over all accumulated candidates: evidence-builder + chain-auditor in batch (mechanical pre-run + SOP aggregation, same spec as the intra-round path, ADR-0008) → novelty final ruling → reporter + Pre-Submit Gate, closed out in one pass.

**Update pipeline_state when done** (CLI, ADR-0004): `python scripts/pipeline_state.py advance --session-dir $SESSION_DIR --phase DEFECT_REVIEW`

**Must use the Agent tool to spawn the reporter sub-agent**:

```
Agent(subagent_type="testvdb:reporter", description="Generate defect reports {target}", prompt="Per the agents/reporter.md spec, generate reports for the following Debate-Confirmed defects: {debate_confirmed}. session_id={session_id}, target={target}, version={version}, session_dir=results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}. Read results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/pipeline_state.json for current progress")
```

**Automated output verification**: after the reporter completes, verify the output with the Bash tool:
```bash
ls results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/defects/defect-*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```
If the output is 0, the reporter did not execute properly; record in error_log.

**Evidence-chain verification requirements**: every defect-N.md the reporter generates must contain a complete evidence chain:
- **Ring 2 (document reference)**: source_url must be reachable; doc_version must match the target major.minor
- **Ring 4 (source reference)**: if the defect involves a specific code path, a github_url must be included

**Pre-Submit Gate reproduction verification**: the reporter must run reproduction verification for every confirmed defect (see agents/reporter.md's Pre-Submit Gate section); only 100%-reproduced defects produce final reports.

#### 8f.5 Per-defect full review (added v2.2 — end-of-round item-by-item audit of reporter output)

**⛔ Iron law: the main process only orchestrates.** The main process runs `python scripts/verify_defects.py` auditing every defect-N.md:
1. Evidence-chain completeness (are Rings 1/2/3 all present)
2. Script-error exclusion (check SCRIPT_ERROR markers)
3. False-positive identification (VERDICT line vs report claims)

(Severity calibration was removed 2026-09-02 — claim audit found it listed in the spec and the script's docstring but never implemented, with no failure precedent motivating its mechanization. Severity grading is the reporter's job at report time, per agents/reporter.md, against the execution logs it quotes; R14.2: no guidance/mechanism without a reproducible failure.)

Produces `defect-review.md`, marking each defect CONFIRMED / FALSE_POSITIVE / NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT.
FALSE_POSITIVE → delete the corresponding defect-N.md. NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT → send back to the reporter for rewrite (at most once).

#### 8g. Save state

**Update pipeline_state when done** (CLI, ADR-0004): `python scripts/pipeline_state.py advance --session-dir $SESSION_DIR --phase STATE_SAVE`
At each round's end save mine_state.json + coverage.json + experience_handoff.json + pipeline_state.json.

**pipeline_state.json (v3 cross-turn state machine, ADR-0004):**

Managed by the `scripts/pipeline_state.py` CLI; hand-constructing the JSON is forbidden. Schema reference: [pipeline_state.py](scripts/pipeline_state.py)'s `PipelineState.create()`.

After each sub-step completes, call `pipeline_state.py advance --phase <NEXT> [--phase-data '...']`. Phase transitions are validated against a hardcoded transition map (invalid jumps → InvalidTransition error). Global state counters update via `pipeline_state.py mutate --total-defects N --coverage P...`. On cross-turn recovery, `reconstruct_context.py` reads this file to determine the breakpoint.

### Inter-agent communication reliability (.done marker files)

Since sub-agents are dispatched asynchronously via the Agent tool, all inter-agent communication goes through the filesystem. To ensure atomicity and visibility of file writes:

1. **Sub-agent output spec**: write the output file first; when complete, create the same-named `.done` marker file
2. **Orchestrator check spec**: **must** check for the `.done` marker file's existence (not merely the output file — the file may be mid-write)
3. **Check command**: `test -f "{file}.done" && echo "READY" || echo "PENDING"`
4. **Timeout handling**: output file exists but `.done` missing for over 60 seconds → the sub-agent is stuck; trigger the timeout
5. **Orchestrator write spec**: write a `.tmp` temp file first; rename + touch `.done` on completion

**experience_handoff.json write logic:**
- Record this round's key findings: debate_confirmed's endpoint distribution, rejection-reason classification, newly discovered high-value attack strategies
- Record the current adjudication-chain state: L1 refuted / verdict_defect / not_defect / needs_more_evidence counts (ADR-0008)
- Enables quickly understanding current progress at the next session or after context-compaction recovery

**experience_handoff.json template** (the orchestrator writes with the Write tool):
```json
{
  "session_id": "{session_id}",
  "target": "{target}",
  "version": "{version}",
  "round": {current_round},
  "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}",
  "key_findings": [
    {"endpoint": "...", "defect_type": "...", "confidence": 0.0, "summary": "..."}
  ],
  "chain_stats": {
    "candidates": 0,
    "l1_refuted": 0,
    "verdict_defect": 0,
    "not_defect": 0,
    "needs_more_evidence": 0
  },
  "rejection_patterns": [
    {"endpoint": "...", "reason": "by-design|false_positive|irreproducible|insufficient_evidence"}
  ],
  "high_value_endpoints": ["..."],
  "exhausted_endpoints": ["..."],
  "next_action": "continue_mining|stalemate|terminate"
}
```

**coverage.json template** (the orchestrator writes with the Write tool):
```json
{
  "session_id": "{session_id}",
  "target": "{target}",
  "version": "{version}",
  "round": {current_round},
  "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}",
  "endpoint_coverage": {
    "{endpoint}": {
      "constraints_tested": 0,
      "constraints_total": 0,
      "defects_found": 0,
      "last_tested_round": 0
    }
  },
  "overall_coverage_pct": 0.0,
  "core_crud_coverage_pct": 0.0
}
```

#### 8h. Analyze this round's output
- Vote-divergence pattern analysis
- Rejection-reason classification (by-design / false positive / irreproducible / insufficient evidence)
- Endpoint coverage update
- Generate reflection_context for the next round

### v2.0 strategy extraction (evolution.enabled=true)

After each round ends (or executed collectively at Step 9), run:
```bash
python scripts/strategy_extractor.py "results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}" {target}
```
Strategy extraction logic:
1. Read this round's experience_handoff.json
2. Extract strategy patterns of confirmed_defects → generalize → merge
3. New strategies → write to strategy_registry (global + per-DB)
4. Existing strategies → update performance counts + adjust confidence
5. Append to evolution_log.jsonl for auditing

#### 8i. Check termination conditions
Terminate the loop when any of the following holds:
1. 5 consecutive rounds with no new defects
2. Contract coverage ≥ 95%
3. max_rounds reached (and > 0)
4. min_defects reached

#### 8j. Inter-round container management
- **Continue to the next round**: restart the DB container to reset state (`docker restart testvdb-{target}-${TESTVDB_SESSION_ID:-standalone}`), keeping data volumes
- **Terminate the loop**: run full cleanup (`docker compose -f docker/{target}.yml down -v`), releasing all resources

### Step 9: Issue drafts + summary report + mandatory container cleanup

**⛔ Absolutely forbidden: the main process or any agent directly submitting Issues to GitHub repositories. All output stays on the local filesystem.**

1. **Generate issue-format drafts** (added v2.2):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p results/{target}/{version}/{timestamp}/issues
   ```
   For every CONFIRMED defect passing 8f.5 review, generate `issues/issue-{N}-{slug}.md`, containing the full Bug Report format (Title, Description, Version, Steps to Reproduce, Expected/Actual Behavior, Impact, Environment, MRE path). Annotate at the bottom: "local draft; requires manual review before manual submission".

2. Generate the `summary.md` + `defect-review.md` summary reports
3. **Mandatory container cleanup**: run the following to clean up all Docker containers and networks created this session:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/{target}.yml down -v --remove-orphans
   docker network rm testvdb-net-${TESTVDB_SESSION_ID:-standalone} 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
4. Verify cleanup completed: `docker ps --filter "name=testvdb-{target}" --format "{{.Names}}"` should output nothing
5. Update `.session.lock`'s status to `completed`

### Stalemate handling (triggered after 5 consecutive rounds with no new defects)
1. Dispatch the Knowledge Extractor to re-search for documentation changes + new issues + community discussion
2. Feed all search results to the Judge Agents to re-examine last round's candidate defects
3. Adjust the attack strategies of the attack agents for low-coverage endpoints
4. If still nothing found → terminate

### Zero-defect ruling
After running all rounds with zero output → annotate `ZERO_DEFECT` in session_metadata.json and generate a diagnostic report:
- which endpoints were tested, which constraints were missed
- coverage analysis
- suggested improvement directions
